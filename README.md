# Jupyter Keras VGG16 Visualizations

These are just notebooks for visualizing weights in Keras layers.  One
notebook pulls the weights out and directly visualizes them.  This is
a pictorial representation of the convolution filter kernel.  The other
notebook displays the evaluation of one or more internal layers with
a grayscale image as input.  This is the projection of the grayscale
image through the collection of convolutions, which also gives some
insight into the weights applied to the incoming data.  In particular,
it shows how the kernels modify data from the mean value given it.
